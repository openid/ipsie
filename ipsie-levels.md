# IPSIE Levels

- *SL* - Session Lifecycle
- *IL* - Identity Lifecycle

Each level includes the previous level (_e.g._ SL3 includes the requirements of SL1 and SL2). SL* and IL* are independent of each other.

| IPSIE<br>LEVEL|   Application (aka RP)                                                 |  Identity Service                                                                                             |

| SL1           |   - MUST meet NIST 800-63-4 FAL2 compliance <br>- Session lifetime MUST be set from the assertion | - MUST meet NIST 800-63-4 FAL2 Compliance <br> - MUST enforce phishing resistance (such as MFA, or passkeys) and communicate an authentication class to the Application |
| SL2           |  - MUST terminate sessions at the request of the Identity Service| - MUST enforce authentication method requests from Application |
| SL3           |  - MUST communicate session state changes to Identity Service | - MUST communicate user, session, and device state changes to the Application |

| IL2           |  - MUST support mapping group claims to application roles and capabilities | - MUST synchronize user group membership claims to Application |
| IL3           |  - MUST expose application roles to the Identity Service | - MUST consume Application roles and map to users<br> - MUST synchronize user role claims to Application |

### IPSIE Session Lifecycle SL1 - Single Sign-On & Session Lifetime Controls

Level SL1 enables basic single sign-on from applications to the identity provider, communicating identity statements about the user. Single sign-on in Level SL1 meets the requirements of [FAL2 in NIST 800-63-4](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63c/fal/). (Note that currently 800-63-4 is in Second Public Draft and may change before final publication. We intend to update the recommendations accordingly if there are relevant changes in the final version.)

The Application respects the session lifetime as communicated by the Identity Service in the assertion, and reauthenticates the user through the Identity Service after the expiration.

The Identity Service MUST communicate information about the user's authentication method at the Identity Service in the SSO assertion.

### IPSIE Session Lifecycle SL2 - MFA, Logout, & Session Termination

Level SL2 adds the ability for the Application to request specific authentication methods when the user logs in at the Identity Service.

The Identity Services MUST be able to communicate a session termination event.  The Application MUST act upon session termination requests from the Identity Services.

### IPSIE Session Lifecycle SL3 - Continuous Access

Level SL3 adds continuous access to the authentication between Identity Service and Application.

The Application communicates session changes to the Identity Service such as IP address change, enabling the Identity Service to be aware of more context around what is happening to users' sessions after the initial sign-in.

The Identity Service communicates changes in the account and device posture to the application, enabling the application to take actions it determines are necessary based on its own policies about these changes.  Neither application nor identity services are obliged to act upon any state changes, the policies for responding to state changes are not in scope for SL3.

### IPSIE Identity Lifecycle Level IL1 - User and Profile Synchronization

IPSIE Lifecycle Level P1 requires the Identity Service to synchonize with the Application the users that have access and their profile data. The Application SHALL NOT independently create, update, or delete users or the provided profile data. While an Application may also support support Just In Time (JIT) for account creation using claims in an SSO token, JIT support is NOT a requirement of IPSIE.

### IPSIE Identity Lifecycle Level IL2 - User Group Membership 

Level P2 adds the ability for the Identity Service to organize users into groups and to synchonize group memberhip with the Application. The Application MUST use group membership to determine the roles and capabilities of the user.

### IPSIE Identity Lifecycle Level IL3 - User Roles

Level P3 adds the ability for the Application to publish the roles that exist in the Application to the Identity Service, and for the Identity Service to map these roles to users and synchronize with the Application which roles each user has.
